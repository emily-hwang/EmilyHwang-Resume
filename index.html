        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Emily Hwang and I was born and raised in Riverside, California. The high school I attended was Woodcrest Christian School System. I graduated in the year 2019 with my High School diploma. I am an 18 year old Pre-Business major studying at the University of California, Riverside. My expected graduation year is the Spring of 2023. I hope to concentrate in Finance as well as take the science classes required to apply to medical school. The long-term goal is to become a Pediatrician in Southern California and maybe run my own practice for those who are less privileged.   <br><br>

        In highschool I played volleyball and still enjoy playing it when I have the time. I also enjoy traveling and trying new foods. I think it is always good to try and experience new things especially if you are somewhere that is rich in a different culture than you are used to. Living in California, I am used to being surrounded by diverse groups of people which has allowed me to become an open minded person. I have had the opportunity to become a citizen of the world by going on missions trips to Cayo, Belize and Kodiak, Alaska. Both of the trips forced me to get out of my comfort zone and see what it is like living in a different part of the world with people who have different day to day lives than I do. I interacted with many kids and their families as we put on programs that brought the community together and helped them with any manual labor they needed to jumpstart their projects. The experience I got from each of these trips had different lessons that I think will benefit me in the future. On my trip to Belize I learned how to humble myself and realized how much I have as well as how much I can give to others who are less fortunate than I am. In Kodiak, Alaska I learned the importance of relationships with others and that there are places in our own country who need our help. I want to continue learning about others and immersing myself in new cultures. 
<br><br>

       My volunteer experience prepared me for my last job as an Administrative Office Assistant in the Education Building at the Riverside University Health System Hospital in Moreno Valley, California. As an Administrative Office Assistant I was surrounded by people who were farther in their career than I was and acted as mentors for me to be better at my job. I advanced my customer service skills by dealing with different types of people by assisting those apart of the organization and those who were unfamiliar with the hospital. My technology skills became more developed with this job as we worked with multiple programs such as Microsoft Access, Google Calendar, and Microsoft Powerpoint. I even got some experience on how to book travel for Administrators through Concur Travel. My clerical skills were basic before working at this job but they gave me the opportunity to learn and strengthen my skills so that I may use them in the future.
